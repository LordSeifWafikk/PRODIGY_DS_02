# Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes loading and cleaning the data, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

## Project Description
This project involves the following steps:

1. Loading and cleaning the data: Handling missing values and ensuring the data types are correct.
2. Univariate analysis: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distributions.
3. Bivariate analysis: Exploring the relationship between pairs of variables.
4. Multivariate analysis: Analyzing the relationship between multiple variables simultaneously.

## Features
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Univariate Analysis: Visualize distributions of individual variables.
- Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables.
- Multivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between multiple variables using pair plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
